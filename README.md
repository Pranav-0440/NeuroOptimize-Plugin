# NeuroOptimize VS Code Plugin

**AI-powered Java optimization hints for @NeuroOptimize annotated methods in VS Code**

---

## 🚀 Overview

NeuroOptimize is a VS Code extension that provides **live optimization hints** for Java methods annotated with `@NeuroOptimize`.  

It helps developers:

- Detect loops that can be parallelized
- Suggest caching for repeated method calls
- Visualize hotspots and execution hints inline

> **Note:** This is the initial skeleton version. Full profiling and automatic refactoring features are planned for future releases.

## 📂 Features

| Feature                 | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Live Profiling**      | Inline hints for performance improvements |
| **AI Suggestions**      | Identify loops for parallelization and caching opportunities |
| **Inline Hints**        | Suggestions appear directly next to annotated methods |
| **Visualization**       | Highlight optimization opportunities in code |
| **Cross-Platform IDE**  | Works on VS Code (future IntelliJ support planned) |

## 🛠 Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pranav-0440/NeuroOptimize-Plugin.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd NeuroOptimize-Plugin
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
4. Compile TypeScript:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
6. Open in VS Code and press F5 to launch a Extension Development Host.

## ✨ Usage

1. Add the @NeuroOptimize annotation above your Java methods:
   ```java
   @NeuroOptimize(cache=true, debug=true)
    public void processData(int[] data) {
        for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            data[i] *= 2;
        }
   }
2. In the VS Code editor, you’ll see hints like:
    ```yaml
    💡 NeuroOptimize Suggestion: Consider parallelizing loops here.

## 📈 Future Plans:
1. Real Java runtime profiling integration
2. Multiple suggestions (caching, method reordering)
3. Graphical execution visualization
4. Support for IntelliJ and other languages (Kotlin, Python via Jupyter)

If you want, I can also create a **version that’s more marketplace-ready** with **badges, demo GIFs, and installation instructions**, so it looks professional for publishing on Visual Studio Marketplace.  

Do you want me to do that next?
